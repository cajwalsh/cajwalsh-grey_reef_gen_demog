The genetic diversity calculations, geographical analyses, and resulting figures can be produced using the diversity_analyses.bash script. All steps in this script and within the other scripts it uses are well-annotated.

This analysis requires a copy of the [Stats_from_SFS_TD.R](https://github.com/Nopaoli/Demographic-Modelling/blob/master/Diversity_fromSFS/Stats_from_SFS_TD.R) script to be downloaded into this directory from co-author Paolo Momigliano's github page.
