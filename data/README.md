This folder contains the list of individuals used in our study in two formats used by different analysis scripts. This folder would also need to contain a vcf file of the project data. SNP calling was performed with extra individuals and technical replicates that were removed before filtered down to the final vcf (see Supplementary Information). To use these scripts on other data, add similar files and edit other scripts to refer to them.
