The joint ngbr_indo sfs is made using the ngbr_indo.bash script (essentially the same way as for each individual population in stairway plot, but including two populations from the vcf instead of just one).

With the joint SFS, the demographic modelling in *moments* can be performed using scripts from the [Shark-Demographic-Models](https://github.com/Nopaoli/Shark-Demographic-Models) repository by co-author Paolo Momigliano.
