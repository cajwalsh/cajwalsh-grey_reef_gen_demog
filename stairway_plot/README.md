The stairway_plot.nf script runs stairway_plot_v2 for all populations. The results can be plotted for each population together using ggplot_stairway_plot.R, or single population plots made by stairway plot that also include confidence intervals can be found in each population's results folder.

A folder containing stairway_plot_v2 must be downloaded into this folder by from the [stairway plot website](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/stairway-plot).

blueprint.blueprint is an adapted version of the blueprint file required for stairway plot runs that is modified for each population in the stairway_plot.nf script
