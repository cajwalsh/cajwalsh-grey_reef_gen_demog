Run NeEstimator.sh to filter and get genepop files (through NeEstimator_prep.R). These genepop files are then run through the command line version NeEstimator 2.1 (following the specifications mentioned in the paper) that must be downloaded and added to this folder (http://www.molecularfisherieslaboratory.com.au/neestimator-software/). Copy results (Ne and jackknife confidence intervals) from each population into an excel file and do the recalibrations referred to in paper. Save as .csv and plot using Ne_plot.R
